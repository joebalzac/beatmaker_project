Beat Machine using JavaScript 

This was made watching a YouTube Tutorial from YouTube DevEd. I highly recoommend subscribing to his channel and learning his cool and fun approach to learning how to code. 
I've always had a love and a deep passion for musis, and music production. Here is just a simple fun beat machine to make a very lo-fi sounding beat. Enjoy. Feel free to make any adjustments or enhancements. 

Thanks,
